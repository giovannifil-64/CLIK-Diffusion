This is the official repository of our paper **CLIK-Diffusion: Clinical Knowledge-informed Diffusion Model for Tooth Alignment** in **Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) 2025**. In this work, we formulate the complex problem of tooth alignment as a more manageable landmark transformation problem, which is further refined into a landmark coordinate generation task via diffusion model. To further encourage the integration of essential clinical knowledge, we design hierarchical constraints from three perspectives: dental-arch level, inter-tooth level, and individual-tooth level.

### Getting Started
First clone this repo. And then set up an environment and install required packages.

```python
git clone https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/CLIK-Diffusion.git

conda create -n tooth python=3.8
conda activate tooth
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing
We now only provide case-by-case code for testing. To test our model ——
* First download both checkpoints of landmark detection network and checkpoints of diffusion model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o9tVJ6p8Jbad3gu0ZUkX0tE5dp7Vkh9g?usp=sharing.
* Then put all five downloaded checkpoints into [`./Code/checkpoint`](./Code/checkpoint).
* We have prepared some data samples for you to start a quick test. The pre-orthodontic tooth meshes are stored in [`./Data`](./Data).
* Run the following command:
    ```python
    cd CLIK-Diffusion
    python Code/infer.py -i "./Data/275" -o "./Output"
    # add argument "-v" if you want see the results of landmark detection network
    ``` 
* You will find the post-orthodontic tooth meshes which are predicted by our method in [`./Output`](./Output).
